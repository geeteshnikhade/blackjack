# Blackjack #

Don't have a deck of cards?
Don't worry, we got you covered!

Here is a **JAVA** implementation of the game Blackjack which can be used to learn or master it. 

The ***conditions*** of the game are as follows:
* See this [Link](https://blog.udemy.com/blackjack-rules-2/) for the rules of Blackjack.
* In our simplified version, the player cannot Double or Split.
* The only actors in game are a single player and the dealer.
* The user is always the player, never the dealer.
* The player starts with $100 to bet.
* The minimum bet for each game is $1.
* The player can play games until they have $0.

## Execution Instructions: ##
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile all the Java classes using command:
`javac Blackjack.java Deck.java Game.java Player.java`
3. Start the game using `java Blackjack`

## Future Scope: ##
1. Functionality for Double/Split.
2. Functionality to support multiple players in a single game.
3. Interactive GUI.
